A random Google Task picker.

TODO:

NOW
- Alternate texts; color schemes? (See https://developer.android.com/design/style/color.html)

SOONER
- Comments
- Don't put my API key on Github
- Start up with most recently used task list (shared prefs...)
- Make spinner text bigger

LATER
- Exception handling
- Better resource practices: strings, colors, widget styles etc.
- Tests
- Deal with nested tasks
- Fix GridLayout for scaling to other resolutions than 480x800 hdpi (via min/max sizes?)
- Emulation test rig (bypass Google Services authentication)
- Simpler / more current auth scheme? (See https://github.com/antonyt/Task-Master/)
- Add Maven/Gradle and ProGuard
- Lots of null (or other undesired) result checking
- Proper class member privacies

- API javadoc https://developers.google.com/resources/api-libraries/documentation/tasks/v1/java/latest/
