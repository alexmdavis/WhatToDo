A random Google Task picker. Now with extra attitude!

Google API access depends on a key in string resource R.id.google_api_key, not included in this repository. (Use an xml file in res/values.)

OAuth (2.0), logging, and some AsyncTask code from Google Task API sample (see quick ref below)

TODO:

- Lots of null (or other undesired) result checking
- Exception handling
- Unit tests
- Proper class member privacy declarations
- Start up with most recently used task list (shared prefs...)
- Use real ActionBar and action menu for moods, rather than spinner
- Make spinner text bigger (selected value, and value list)
- Better resource practices: strings, colors, widget styles (especially) etc.
- Deal with nested tasks
- Scale to other resolutions/orientations than 480x800 hdpi portrait. Current GridLayout is probably mostly sound but may need some min/max sizes added.
- Emulation test rig (bypass Google Services authentication)
- Simpler / more current auth scheme? (See https://github.com/antonyt/Task-Master/)
- Add Maven/Gradle and ProGuard
- Random mood should change spinner selection?
- Remove redundancy of 'ordinary' mood strings (currently in both layout xml for init, and string xml for re-selection)
- probabilistic mood string grammars!
- gradient_blue drawable is probably unnecessary
- Apache 2.0 license requires marking code changes. Probably I should just rewrite the reused stuff, most of which will be gone anyway after these TODO's.
