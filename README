A random Google Task picker. Now with attitude!

TODO:

NOW
- Mood texts

SOONER
- Cleanup: Comments, licensing, TODOs
- Github (don't include API key...)

LATER
- Unit tests
- Exception handling
- Lots of null (or other undesired) result checking
- Start up with most recently used task list (shared prefs...)
- Use real ActionBar and action menu for moods, rather than spinner
- Make spinner text bigger
- Better resource practices: strings, colors, widget styles (especially) etc.
- Deal with nested tasks
- Fix GridLayout for scaling to other resolutions/orientations than 480x800 hdpi portrait. Layout is probably mostly sound but may need some min/max sizes added.
- Emulation test rig (bypass Google Services authentication)
- Simpler / more current auth scheme? (See https://github.com/antonyt/Task-Master/)
- Add Maven/Gradle and ProGuard
- Proper class member privacies
- Random mood should change mood spinner selection?
- Remove redundancy of 'ordinary' mood strings
- probabilistic CFG mood strings
